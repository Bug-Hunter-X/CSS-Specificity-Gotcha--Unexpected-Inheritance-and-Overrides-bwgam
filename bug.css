The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This will override the color of both the div and the p tags */
}

.special-class p {
  color: purple; /* This will only affect the p tag inside an element with the class 'special-class'. Because of higher specificity */
}
```

The unexpected behavior stems from the interplay between inheritance and specificity.  The `div p` selector has higher specificity than the `div` selector, causing `color: green` to override the inherited `color: blue` from the `div`. Similarly, `.special-class p` takes precedence over both because of the class selector, resulting in `color: purple`.

This situation can lead to confusion when styles don't apply as expected due to the cascade and specificity rules.
