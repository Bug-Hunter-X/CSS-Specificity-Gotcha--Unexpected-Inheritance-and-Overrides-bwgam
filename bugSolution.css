Several approaches can resolve this issue:

1. **Increase Specificity:** If you need the `div`'s color to take precedence over the more specific selectors, you can increase its specificity by adding an ID or more class selectors.

2. **Use !important:** While generally discouraged for maintaining CSS maintainability, using `!important` can force a style to take precedence (but it should be used sparingly).   However, this is not best practice and should be avoided if possible.

3. **Revise Selectors:**  The best approach is to revise your selectors to be more precise and avoid conflicts. Consider the overall structure of your HTML and select elements more appropriately.  Proper use of classes and IDs can greatly enhance the maintainability and predictability of your CSS.

Example of a revised CSS (bugSolution.css):

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

.div-p {
  color: green; /* Style only the p elements with this specific class */
}

.special-class p {
  color: purple; /* This selector remains highly specific but is clearly intended */
}
```

This demonstrates improved organization and eliminates the unexpected style conflict.  The example shows how using a class to clearly indicate a specific style is preferable to relying on complex and overly broad selectors.
